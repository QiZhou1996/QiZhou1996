## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on data analysis projects.
At GitHub, my main goals for 2025 are:
  1. documenting (and sharing) knowledge and experience in data analytics;
  2. practicing five or six data analysis projects with different focuses such as visualization and storytelling;
  3. thus, strengthening fundamental skills in data analysis.
